        <h1>About me!</h1>
         <p>I am Andia. This is how I am known by those who love my music, this is how I am called by my close ones. 
            <br>I was born in a musical family. In our home there was always a radio on, playing music of all kinds, 
            <br>and all family members sang, from my mother and father to my three older brothers. So there was no 
            <br>surprise that I wanted also to be on the stage from a young age, singing the songs I would hear 
            <br>around the house, sung by my folks or by the famous artists I would hear on the radio or tape recorder.</p>
        <p>I feel as if I was born with music in my blood, like Iâ€™ve always known that I wanted to sing and could 
            <br>sing. In my childhood everything seemed easier when I was singing, and later I understood that 
            <br>this was how I best expressed myself, and this was what represented me.
